#### Example 1: Basic Interactive Tutorial Using Jupyter Notebook

---

### 1. Introduction

In this example, we will create a basic interactive tutorial using Jupyter Notebook, a powerful tool for creating and sharing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. This aligns with the concepts discussed in our lecture on "Introduction to Interactive Tutorials: Engaging learners through interactivity." 

Jupyter Notebooks are particularly effective in EdTech because they allow for a combination of code execution and rich text elements (like explanations and storytelling), which can make learning more engaging and interactive. This example will demonstrate how to leverage these capabilities to create an educational experience that captures the imagination of young learners.

### 2. Code Snippet

Below is a well-commented code snippet that demonstrates a basic interactive tutorial in Jupyter Notebook. This example will guide students through a simple Python coding exercise where they interact with the code by providing input.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import random

def interactive_tutorial():
    """
    This function runs a simple interactive tutorial where the user guesses a number.
    """
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")
    
    # Generate a random number between 1 and 10
    number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    
    # Initialize the number of attempts
    attempts = 0
    
    while True:
        try:
            # Ask the user to guess the number
            user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
            
            # Increment the number of attempts
            attempts += 1
            
            # Check if the user's guess is correct
            if user_guess < number_to_guess:
                print("Too low! Try again.")
            elif user_guess > number_to_guess:
                print("Too high! Try again.")
            else:
                print(f"Congratulations! You've guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
                break
        except ValueError:
            # Handle the case where the input is not an integer
            print("Invalid input! Please enter an integer.")
    
# Run the interactive tutorial
interactive_tutorial()
```

### 3. Explanation

Let's break down the code step-by-step to understand how it implements key concepts from the lecture:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   - `import random`: This imports the `random` module, which allows us to generate random numbers.

2. **Defining the Function**:
   - `def interactive_tutorial()`: This defines a function named `interactive_tutorial` that encapsulates our interactive tutorial logic.

3. **Introduction Message**:
   - `print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")`: This prints a welcome message to introduce the game.
   - `print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.")`: This sets the context for the game.

4. **Generating a Random Number**:
   - `number_to_guess = random.randint(1, 10)`: This generates a random integer between 1 and 10, which the user has to guess.

5. **Initializing Attempts**:
   - `attempts = 0`: This initializes a counter to keep track of the number of attempts made by the user.

6. **User Interaction Loop**:
   - `while True`: This starts an infinite loop that will continue until the user guesses the correct number.
   - `user_guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))`: This prompts the user to enter their guess and converts it to an integer.
   - `attempts += 1`: This increments the attempt counter each time the user makes a guess.
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) check if the user's guess is too low, too high, or correct, providing appropriate feedback.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - `except ValueError`: This catches any `ValueError` exceptions (e.g., if the user enters non-integer input) and prompts the user to enter a valid integer.

8. **Breaking Out of Loop**:
   - `break`: This exits the loop once the user guesses the correct number.

### 4. Application

**Real-World Application in EdTech**:

Interactive tutorials like this one can be used in various educational contexts to make learning more engaging for kids:

- **Gamified Learning**: Turning coding exercises into games (like guessing numbers) can make learning more fun and less intimidating for kids.
- **Immediate Feedback**: Interactive elements provide real-time feedback, helping learners understand their mistakes and correct them immediately.
- **Storytelling Integration**: By weaving coding exercises into narratives (e.g., guiding a character through challenges), you can make abstract concepts more concrete and relatable.

**Example Use Case**:
Imagine using this interactive tutorial in an online coding class for kids. The instructor can guide students through the code, explaining each part while allowing them to run and modify it in real-time. This hands-on approach helps solidify their understanding and keeps them engaged.
