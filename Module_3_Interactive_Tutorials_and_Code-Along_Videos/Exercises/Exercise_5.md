### Module Title: Interactive Tutorials and Code-Along Videos ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

#### 1. Problem Statement ####
You are tasked with creating an interactive code-along tutorial for kids aged 8-15. This tutorial should incorporate storytelling elements and visual aids to enhance engagement. Specifically, you need to embed an image or video into the tutorial to illustrate a key concept. 

**Scenario:** 
You are designing a code-along session where kids will help a character named Alex navigate through a maze to find hidden treasure. The session will include a video introduction of Alex and an image of the maze. Your task is to embed these multimedia elements into your interactive tutorial.

**Requirements:**
1. Embed a video introduction of Alex at the beginning of the tutorial.
2. Embed an image of the maze where Alex needs to navigate.
3. Use storytelling to guide the learners through the coding task.
4. Include checkpoints where learners can pause and try coding themselves.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code ####
Here is the starter code for your interactive tutorial. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality:

```python
# Import necessary libraries for embedding multimedia
import IPython.display as display

# Function to display video introduction
def show_video(video_url):
    # Use IPython display function to embed video
    display.Video(url=video_url, embed=True)

# Function to display image of the maze
def show_image(image_url):
    # Use IPython display function to embed image
    display.Image(url=image_url)

# Storytelling introduction
def introduction():
    print("Welcome to the adventure! Meet Alex, our brave explorer.")
    show_video("_______")  # Embed the video URL here

# Maze navigation instructions
def navigate_maze():
    print("Here's the maze Alex needs to navigate:")
    show_image("_______")  # Embed the image URL here
    print("Let's help Alex find the hidden treasure by writing code.")

# Code-along session with interactive checkpoints
def code_along():
    print("Step 1: Move Alex to the right.")
    direction = input("Enter direction (left/right/up/down): ")
    move_character(direction)
    
    print("Step 2: Move Alex down.")
    direction = input("Enter direction (left/right/up/down): ")
    move_character(direction)

# Function to move character based on direction
def move_character(direction):
    if direction == "left":
        position.x -= 1
    elif direction == "right":
        position.x += 1
    elif direction == "up":
        position.y += 1
    elif direction == "down":
        position.y -= 1
    print(f"Alex moved {direction}. Current position: ({position.x}, {position.y})")

# Main function to run the tutorial
def main():
    introduction()
    navigate_maze()
    code_along()

# Run the tutorial
main()
```

#### 3. Hints ####
1. **Hint for Video Embedding:**
   - Look up how to use `IPython.display.Video` to embed videos in Jupyter notebooks or similar environments.
   - Ensure the video URL is accessible and correctly formatted.

2. **Hint for Image Embedding:**
   - Use `IPython.display.Image` to embed images.
   - Make sure the image URL points to a valid image file (e.g., .jpg, .png).

3. **Hint for Storytelling Integration:**
   - Think about how you can narrate Alex's journey through the maze.
   - Use print statements to provide context and instructions at each step.

#### 4. Expected Outcome ####
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, resulting in a functional interactive tutorial that:
- Embeds a video introduction of Alex.
- Displays an image of the maze.
- Guides learners through coding steps with storytelling elements.
- Allows learners to interactively move Alex through the maze by inputting directions.

The final solution should include:
- Correct embedding of multimedia elements.
- Clear and engaging storytelling.
- Interactive checkpoints where learners can participate actively.
- Well-commented code explaining each step and its purpose.

### Integration ###
Ensure that your exercise content is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting, and include any necessary files or resources as links.

```markdown
# Interactive Tutorial: Help Alex Navigate the Maze

## Introduction
Welcome to the adventure! Meet Alex, our brave explorer.

## Maze Navigation
Here's the maze Alex needs to navigate:

![Maze Image](image_url)

Let's help Alex find the hidden treasure by writing code.

## Code-Along Session

### Step 1: Move Alex to the Right
Enter direction (left/right/up/down):

### Step 2: Move Alex Down
Enter direction (left/right/up/down):

## Summary
Great job! You've helped Alex navigate through the maze and find the hidden treasure.

## Next Steps
In our next session, we'll learn how to add more complex movements and interactions for Alex. Stay tuned!
```

By following these guidelines, you'll create an engaging and educational coding experience for kids that integrates multimedia elements effectively.
