### Module Title: Interactive Tutorials and Code-Along Videos

### Exercise Requirements

#### Problem Statement:
Create a problem that requires the student to apply "Exercise 4: Use Scratch to create an interactive coding lesson for kids" to a scenario directly related to the content covered in the lecture "Tools for Creating Interactive Tutorials: Overview of Popular Tools".

**Scenario:**
You are tasked with creating an engaging and educational coding lesson for kids aged 8-15 using Scratch. Your goal is to design an interactive story-based lesson that teaches basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and variables. The lesson should be captivating and fun, integrating storytelling elements to keep the kids engaged.

**Requirements:**
1. Design an interactive story where the main character embarks on a simple adventure.
2. Use Scratch's drag-and-drop interface to create animations and dialogues.
3. Incorporate basic programming concepts:
   - Use loops to repeat actions.
   - Use conditionals to create decision points in the story.
   - Use variables to track the character's progress or inventory.
4. Ensure the lesson is easy to follow and encourages creativity.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Provide starter code with strategically placed blanks that the student must fill in to complete the functionality. The code should include comments and guidance relevant to storytelling and be appropriate for someone with intermediate experience.

```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts in Scratch

# Step 1: Create characters and backgrounds
# Add sprites for the main character and other elements
main_character = _______  # Add main character sprite
background = _______      # Add background

# Step 2: Set up initial positions and variables
main_character.goto(_______, _______)  # Set initial position
score = _______  # Initialize score variable

# Step 3: Create a loop for the main character's movement
for _ in range(10):  # Loop 10 times
    main_character.move(_______)  # Move character forward
    if main_character.touching(_______):  # Check for collision with an obstacle
        main_character.say("Ouch!")  # Display message
        score -= 1  # Decrease score

# Step 4: Add conditionals for decision points
if main_character.touching(_______):  # Check if character reaches a decision point
    choice = input("Do you want to go left or right? (left/right): ")
    if choice == "left":
        main_character.turn_left(90)
    elif choice == "right":
        main_character.turn_right(90)

# Step 5: Display final message and score
main_character.say(f"Your adventure ends here. Your score is {score}.")
```

#### Hints:
1. **Hint for Step 1:** Think about what sprites you need for your story. The main character could be a hero, and you might need obstacles or other characters.
2. **Hint for Step 2:** Use Scratch's built-in functions to position your characters. Variables can be created using the "Variables" block in Scratch.
3. **Hint for Step 3:** Use the "move" block to move your character and "if touching" block to check for collisions.
4. **Hint for Step 4:** Use the "if then else" block to create decision points. You can ask the user for input using the "ask" block.
5. **Hint for Step 5:** Use the "say" block to display messages and concatenate strings with variables.

#### Expected Outcome:
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how the concepts apply to real-world scenarios in EdTech. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

**Example Solution:**
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts in Scratch

# Step 1: Create characters and backgrounds
# Add sprites for the main character and other elements
main_character = Sprite("Hero")  # Add main character sprite
background = Background("AdventureLand")  # Add background

# Step 2: Set up initial positions and variables
main_character.goto(0, -100)  # Set initial position
score = 10  # Initialize score variable

# Step 3: Create a loop for the main character's movement
for _ in range(10):  # Loop 10 times
    main_character.move(10)  # Move character forward
    if main_character.touching("Obstacle"):  # Check for collision with an obstacle
        main_character.say("Ouch!")  # Display message
        score -= 1  # Decrease score

# Step 4: Add conditionals for decision points
if main_character.touching("DecisionPoint"):  # Check if character reaches a decision point
    choice = input("Do you want to go left or right? (left/right): ")
    if choice == "left":
        main_character.turn_left(90)
    elif choice == "right":
        main_character.turn_right(90)

# Step 5: Display final message and score
main_character.say(f"Your adventure ends here. Your score is {score}.")
```

### Integration
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
