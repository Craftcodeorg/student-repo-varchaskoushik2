### Assignment: Develop an Interactive Tutorial that Teaches Kids How to Create a Simple Story Using Python

#### Problem Statement:
In this assignment, you will create an interactive tutorial designed to teach kids how to build a simple text-based adventure story using Python. This tutorial will incorporate storytelling elements and interactivity to engage young learners. Your goal is to design a tutorial that guides kids through creating a story where they can make choices that affect the outcome.

#### Starter Code:
Below is the starter code for a simple interactive story. You will expand upon this code to create a more detailed and engaging story.

```python
# Starter code for a simple interactive story
def start_story():
    print("Welcome to the Adventure Story!")
    choice = input("You find yourself in a dark forest. Do you go left or right? (left/right): ")
    
    if choice == "left":
        print("You encounter a friendly elf who offers you a magical potion.")
        # Add more choices and story elements here
    elif choice == "right":
        print("You find a hidden treasure chest filled with gold!")
        # Add more choices and story elements here
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Try again.")
        start_story()

# Start the story
start_story()
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Expand the Story**:
   - Add at least two more decision points in the story where the user can make choices.
   - Each decision point should lead to different outcomes, creating multiple paths through the story.

2. **Integrate Storytelling Elements**:
   - Use descriptive language to make the story more engaging.
   - Introduce characters, items, or events that make the story interesting and relatable for kids.

3. **Enhance Interactivity**:
   - Include at least one interactive element where the user can input their name, which will be used throughout the story.
   - Add feedback messages based on the user's choices to make the experience more dynamic.

4. **Add Error Handling**:
   - Ensure that invalid inputs (e.g., typing something other than "left" or "right") are handled gracefully, prompting the user to try again.

5. **Test Your Tutorial**:
   - Run the tutorial multiple times to ensure all paths work correctly and provide a smooth user experience.
   - Make sure the story is engaging and easy to follow for kids aged 8-15.

#### Example of an Expanded Story:
```python
def start_story():
    print("Welcome to the Adventure Story!")
    name = input("What's your name, brave adventurer? ")
    print(f"Hello, {name}! Let's begin your adventure.")
    
    choice1 = input("You find yourself in a dark forest. Do you go left or right? (left/right): ")
    
    if choice1 == "left":
        print("You encounter a friendly elf who offers you a magical potion.")
        choice2 = input("Do you drink the potion or save it for later? (drink/save): ")
        
        if choice2 == "drink":
            print(f"The potion gives you super strength, {name}! You feel unstoppable.")
            # Continue the story with more choices
        elif choice2 == "save":
            print(f"You decide to save the potion for later, {name}. You never know when it might come in handy.")
            # Continue the story with more choices
        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Try again.")
            start_story()
    
    elif choice1 == "right":
        print("You find a hidden treasure chest filled with gold!")
        choice2 = input("Do you take the gold or leave it? (take/leave): ")
        
        if choice2 == "take":
            print(f"You take the gold and feel rich beyond your wildest dreams, {name}!")
            # Continue the story with more choices
        elif choice2 == "leave":
            print(f"You decide to leave the gold and continue your adventure, {name}.")
            # Continue the story with more choices
        else:
            print("Invalid choice! Try again.")
            start_story()
    
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Try again.")
        start_story()

# Start the story
start_story()
```

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Story Expansion**: The story should have at least two additional decision points, creating multiple paths.
- **Engagement**: Use descriptive language and introduce interesting characters or items.
