### Assignment 2: Create a Code-Along Video That Guides Viewers Through Building a Basic Game Using Scratch

---

#### Problem Statement

Your task is to create a code-along video that teaches kids how to build a basic game using Scratch. The game will involve a character that moves around the screen to collect coins, with the goal of collecting as many coins as possible within a given time limit. This assignment will help you apply storytelling and interactive elements to keep young learners engaged, as discussed in the lecture "Best Practices for Code-Along Videos: Keeping Viewers Engaged."

#### Starter Code and Framework

Since Scratch is a visual programming language, there is no traditional "starter code." However, here is a step-by-step framework to guide you in creating your code-along video:

1. **Introduction (Beginning):**
    - Introduce the game concept and the main character.
    - Explain the objective of the game (collecting coins).
    - Set the context and goals for the tutorial.

2. **Setting Up the Game (Middle):**
    - **Step 1:** Create a new Scratch project.
    - **Step 2:** Add a sprite for the main character (e.g., a cat).
    - **Step 3:** Add a sprite for the coins.
    - **Step 4:** Create a backdrop for the game.

3. **Coding the Game Logic (Middle):**
    - **Step 5:** Program the character to move using arrow keys.
    - **Step 6:** Program the coins to appear at random positions.
    - **Step 7:** Create a score variable to keep track of collected coins.
    - **Step 8:** Add logic to increase the score when the character touches a coin and make the coin disappear.

4. **Adding Interactive Elements (Middle):**
    - **Step 9:** Pause regularly to ask viewers to predict what will happen next.
    - **Step 10:** Encourage viewers to test their code and provide immediate feedback on common mistakes.

5. **Conclusion (End):**
    - Summarize what was built in the tutorial.
    - Discuss possible extensions or next steps for enhancing the game.

#### Detailed Instructions

**Step 1: Introduction**

- Introduce yourself and briefly explain what you will be creating in this tutorial.
- Describe the game's objective: "In this game, our character will move around the screen to collect coins. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible within a given time limit."

**Step 2: Setting Up the Game**

- Open Scratch and create a new project.
- Add a sprite for the main character (e.g., choose the cat sprite).
- Add a sprite for the coins (e.g., choose a coin or create your own).
- Choose or create a backdrop for the game environment.

**Step 3: Coding the Game Logic**

- **Movement:**
    - Explain how to use arrow keys to move the character.
    - Demonstrate how to add code blocks for moving up, down, left, and right.

- **Random Coin Placement:**
    - Show how to place coins at random positions on the screen.
    - Use blocks like "go to random position" and "when green flag clicked."

- **Score Keeping:**
    - Create a variable named "score."
    - Show how to increase the score when the character touches a coin.
    - Use blocks like "change score by 1" and "hide" for the coin.

**Step 4: Adding Interactive Elements**

- Pause after each major coding step and ask viewers to predict what will happen when they run their code.
- Encourage viewers to test their code and provide tips on common mistakes (e.g., character not moving correctly, coins not disappearing).

**Step 5: Conclusion**

- Summarize what was accomplished in the tutorial: "We created a basic game where our character collects coins. We learned how to move the character, place coins randomly, and keep track of the score."
- Suggest possible extensions: "You can add more features like a timer, different levels, or obstacles."

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation

**Success Criteria:**

1. **Engagement:**
   - The video uses storytelling techniques to create a compelling narrative.
   - Interactive elements are incorporated to keep viewers actively involved.

2. **Clarity:**
   - Instructions are clear and easy to follow.
   - The pace is balanced, allowing viewers time to process information.

3. **Technical Accuracy:**
   - The game functions as described (character moves, coins appear randomly, score increases).
   - The code is correct and free of errors.

4. **Visual and Auditory Quality:**
   - The screen recording is clear, with important sections highlighted.
   - The voiceover is enthusiastic, with varied pitch and tone.

**Evaluation Rubric:**

| Criteria                | Excellent (5) | Good (4) | Satisfactory (3) | Needs Improvement (2) | Poor (1) |
|-------------------------|---------------|----------|------------------|-----------------------|----------|
| Engagement              | Highly engaging narrative and frequent interactive elements | Engaging narrative with some interactive elements | Basic narrative with minimal interaction | Limited narrative and interaction | No narrative or interaction |
| Clarity                 | Very clear instructions, well-paced | Clear instructions, good pace | Somewhat clear instructions, pace could improve | Instructions are confusing, pace is off | Very unclear instructions, poor pacing |
| Technical Accuracy      | Game works perfectly, no errors | Game works with minor issues | Game mostly works, some errors | Game has significant issues | Game does not work |
| Visual & Auditory Quality| High-quality visuals and audio | Good visuals and audio | Acceptable visuals and audio | Poor visuals or audio | Very poor visuals or audio |

#### Next Steps

In our next lecture, we'll dive into "Incorporating Game-Based Learning in Code-Along Videos." We'll explore how you can integrate game mechanics into your tutorials to make learning even more fun and interactive.

**Preparatory Actions:**

- Review your favorite educational videos and note down elements that kept you engaged.
- Think about a simple coding project you'd like to turn into a code-along video and outline a basic narrative for it.

Stay tuned, and happy coding!
