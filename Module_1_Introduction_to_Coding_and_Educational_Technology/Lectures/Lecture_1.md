#### 3. **Core Concepts**:

**a. What is Coding?**
- **Definition**: Coding is the act of writing instructions in a language that computers can understand to perform specific tasks.
- **Basic Components**: These include syntax (rules), semantics (meaning), and logic (flow of instructions).

**b. Why is Coding Important?**
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Coding teaches logical thinking and problem-solving.
- **Creativity**: It allows for the creation of new applications, games, and interactive stories.
- **Future-Proofing Careers**: Coding skills are increasingly in demand across various industries.

**c. Coding Languages**:
- **Common Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Scratch (great for kids).
- **Choosing a Language**: Start with languages that are beginner-friendly and widely used in educational technology.

#### 4. **Practical Application**:

**Example 1: Storytelling with Code**
- **Interactive Stories**: Platforms like Twine allow storytellers to create branching narratives where the reader's choices influence the story's outcome.
- **Simple Code Snippet (Twine)**:
  ```twine
  :: Start
  You find yourself in a dark forest. Do you go left or right?
  [[Go Left|Left Path]]
  [[Go Right|Right Path]]

  :: Left Path
  You encounter a friendly elf who offers you a quest.
  [[Accept Quest|Quest]]

  :: Right Path
  You find a hidden treasure chest filled with gold.
  ```

**Example 2: Educational Games**
- **Math Games for Kids**: Using Scratch to create simple math games where kids solve problems to advance levels.
- **Simple Code Snippet (Scratch)**:
  - Create a sprite that asks a math question.
  - Use blocks to check if the answer is correct and provide feedback.
