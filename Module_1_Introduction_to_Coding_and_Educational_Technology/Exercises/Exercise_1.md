### Exercise 1: Create a Variable and Assign it a Value ###

---

#### Problem Statement:
In this exercise, you will create a variable and assign it a value to help create an interactive story for kids. Imagine you are developing a simple interactive story where a character named Alex finds different items in a magical forest. You need to create variables to store the items Alex finds and print a message describing what Alex has discovered.

#### Instructions:
1. Create a variable named `item1` and assign it the value `"magic wand"`.
2. Create a variable named `item2` and assign it the value `"golden key"`.
3. Print a message that combines these variables into a sentence describing what Alex has found.

---

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts

# Create variables to store the items found by Alex
item1 = "______ ______"
item2 = "______ ____"

# Print a message describing what Alex has found
print("Alex found a " + ______ + " and a " + ______ + " in the magical forest.")
```

---

#### Hints:
1. **Hint 1**: Recall that a variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.
2. **Hint 2**: Make sure to use the exact values provided in the instructions for `item1` and `item2`.
3. **Hint 3**: Use the `+` operator to concatenate strings in Python.

#### Expected Outcome:
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to create variables and assign them values. The final solution should print the following message:
```python
Alex found a magic wand and a golden key in the magical forest.
```

The completed code should look like this:
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts

# Create variables to store the items found by Alex
item1 = "magic wand"
item2 = "golden key"

# Print a message describing what Alex has found
print("Alex found a " + item1 + " and a " + item2 + " in the magical forest.")
```
