### Module Title: Introduction to Coding and Educational Technology

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
In this exercise, you will create a simple interactive story using Python. The story will involve making decisions based on user input, which will require you to write `if` statements to check conditions. This exercise will help you understand how storytelling can be integrated with coding to create engaging learning experiences for kids.

**Scenario:**
You are creating an interactive story for kids where they need to make choices that affect the outcome of the story. For example, the story could be about a character who needs to choose between different paths in a forest. Depending on the choice, the story will proceed differently.

**Objective:**
Write an `if` statement to check the user's choice and print the corresponding part of the story.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
# Starter code for creating an interactive story

def interactive_story():
    print("Welcome to the Interactive Forest Adventure!")
    print("You are standing at a fork in the path.")
    print("Do you want to go left or right?")
    
    # Get the user's choice
    choice = input("Type 'left' or 'right': ").lower()
    
    # Check the user's choice and print the corresponding part of the story
    if choice == 'left':
        print("You chose the left path and found a beautiful waterfall!")
        print("The end of this path is peaceful and serene.")
    elif choice == 'right':
        print("You chose the right path and encountered a friendly dragon!")
        print("The dragon offers you a ride to see the entire forest from above.")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please type 'left' or 'right'.")
    
# Run the interactive story function
interactive_story()
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1:** Remember to use `input()` to get user input and `.lower()` to handle case sensitivity.
- **Hint 2:** Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to check the user's choice and print different outcomes.
- **Hint 3:** Make sure to handle invalid inputs by providing a message that guides the user to enter a valid choice.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- Write `if` statements to check user input conditions.
- Create a simple interactive story that changes based on user choices.
- Apply storytelling techniques to make coding concepts more engaging for kids.

**Final Solution:**
```python
# Starter code for creating an interactive story

def interactive_story():
    print("Welcome to the Interactive Forest Adventure!")
    print("You are standing at a fork in the path.")
    print("Do you want to go left or right?")
    
    # Get the user's choice
    choice = input("Type 'left' or 'right': ").lower()
    
    # Check the user's choice and print the corresponding part of the story
    if choice == 'left':
        print("You chose the left path and found a beautiful waterfall!")
        print("The end of this path is peaceful and serene.")
    elif choice == 'right':
        print("You chose the right path and encountered a friendly dragon!")
        print("The dragon offers you a ride to see the entire forest from above.")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please type 'left' or 'right'.")
    
# Run the interactive story function
interactive_story()
```

### Integration
- Ensure that this exercise is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into your learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.

**Note:** This exercise aligns with your interests in storytelling, game-based learning, and creating engaging educational content for kids. It also integrates well with your intermediate coding skills and project-based learning preferences.
