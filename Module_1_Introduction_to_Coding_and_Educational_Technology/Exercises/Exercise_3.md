### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. **Problem Statement**:
Create a function that helps kids learn about decision-making in storytelling. The function should take a choice as input and return the corresponding story outcome. This exercise will reinforce your understanding of syntax and semantics, as discussed in Lecture 3.

---

#### 2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts

def story_outcome(choice):
    """
    This function takes a choice as input and returns the corresponding story outcome.
    """
    if choice == "left":
        return "You find a treasure chest!"
    elif choice == "right":
        return "You encounter a dragon!"
    else:
        return "Invalid choice, try again."

# Test the function with example values from the lecture
print(story_outcome("left"))  # Expected output: You find a treasure chest!
print(story_outcome("right"))  # Expected output: You encounter a dragon!
print(story_outcome("forward"))  # Expected output: Invalid choice, try again.
```

---

#### 3. **Hints**:
- **Hint 1**: Remember that the `if` statement checks if the condition is true and executes the corresponding block of code.
- **Hint 2**: Use `elif` for additional conditions that should be checked if the previous `if` condition is false.
- **Hint 3**: Use `else` for the default case when none of the previous conditions are met.
- **Hint 4**: Make sure your function returns a string that matches the expected outcome for each choice.

---

#### 4. **Expected Outcome**:
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how syntax and semantics apply to creating interactive stories. The final solution should be well-commented, explaining the reasoning behind each step, and should include error handling for invalid choices.

---

### Integration
Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.

---

#### Example Solution:
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts

def story_outcome(choice):
    """
    This function takes a choice as input and returns the corresponding story outcome.
    """
    if choice == "left":
        return "You find a treasure chest!"
    elif choice == "right":
        return "You encounter a dragon!"
    else:
        return "Invalid choice, try again."

# Test the function with example values from the lecture
print(story_outcome("left"))  # Expected output: You find a treasure chest!
print(story_outcome("right"))  # Expected output: You encounter a dragon!
print(story_outcome("forward"))  # Expected output: Invalid choice, try again.
```

By completing this exercise, you will reinforce your understanding of syntax and semantics in Python, particularly in the context of creating engaging educational content for kids. This will help you design interactive and captivating coding lessons that make learning fun and intuitive for young learners.
