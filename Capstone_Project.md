Capstone Project Title: Developing an Interactive Educational Game for Kids

Description:
Create an interactive educational game aimed at kids aged 8-15 that combines storytelling, math tutoring, and basic coding concepts. The game should be engaging, fun, and educational, leveraging the principles of game-based learning and storytelling.

Requirements:
1. The game should have a clear storyline that captivates young learners.
2. Include interactive elements that teach basic coding concepts (variables, loops, conditionals).
3. Integrate math tutoring exercises within the game to reinforce arithmetic skills.
4. Use Scratch or Python as the primary development platform.
5. Ensure the game has clear instructions and feedback mechanisms to guide learners.

Deliverables:
1. A fully functional interactive educational game.
2. A detailed project report explaining the design process, educational objectives, and implementation details.
3. A video walkthrough demonstrating the game's features and how it engages learners.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Creativity and originality of the game's concept.
2. Effectiveness in teaching coding concepts and math skills.
3. Quality of storytelling and interactive elements.
4. Usability and engagement level for kids aged 8-15.
5. Completeness and clarity of the project report.
