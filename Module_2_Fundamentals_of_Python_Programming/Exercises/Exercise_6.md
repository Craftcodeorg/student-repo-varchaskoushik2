### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. **Problem Statement**:
Create a program that asks the user to input a list of their favorite books and then prints each book using a loop. This exercise will require the student to apply the concepts of input and output covered in Lecture 6: Basic Input and Output: Interacting with Users.

**Scenario**:
Imagine you are creating a simple interactive application for kids that allows them to create a list of their favorite books. The program will ask the user to input the number of books they want to list, then prompt them to enter each book's name. Finally, it will print out the list of books one by one.

**Steps**:
1. Ask the user how many books they want to list.
2. Use a loop to gather the names of the books from the user.
3. Use another loop to print each book's name.

#### 2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts

# Step 1: Ask the user how many books they want to list
num_books = int(input("How many favorite books do you want to list? "))

# Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store the book names
favorite_books = []

# Step 3: Use a loop to gather the names of the books from the user
for i in range(num_books):
    book_name = input("Enter the name of book {}: ".format(i + 1))
    favorite_books.append(book_name)

# Step 4: Use another loop to print each book's name
print("Here are your favorite books:")
for book in favorite_books:
    print(book)
```

#### 3. **Hints**:
- **Hint 1**: Remember to convert the input for the number of books into an integer using `int()`.
- **Hint 2**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the range of numbers from 0 to `num_books - 1` to collect book names.
- **Hint 3**: Use the `append()` method to add each book name to the `favorite_books` list.
- **Hint 4**: Use another `for` loop to iterate through the `favorite_books` list and print each book name.

#### 4. **Expected Outcome**:
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to gather user input, store it in a list, and then iterate through that list to print each item. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling (such as ensuring the number of books is a positive integer), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step.

```python
# Complete code with filled-in blanks

# Step 1: Ask the user how many books they want to list
num_books = int(input("How many favorite books do you want to list? "))

# Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store the book names
favorite_books = []

# Step 3: Use a loop to gather the names of the books from the user
for i in range(num_books):
    book_name = input("Enter the name of book {}: ".format(i + 1))
    favorite_books.append(book_name)

# Step 4: Use another loop to print each book's name
print("Here are your favorite books:")
for book in favorite_books:
    print(book)
```

### Integration
- Ensure that this exercise is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
