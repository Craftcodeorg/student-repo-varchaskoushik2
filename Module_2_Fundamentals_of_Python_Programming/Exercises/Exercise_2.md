### Module Title: Fundamentals of Python Programming

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement
Create a problem that requires the student to apply "Exercise 2: Create variables of different data types and print them" to a scenario directly related to the content covered in "### Lecture: Basic Syntax and Structure: Writing your first Python program".

**Scenario:**
You are designing an interactive storytelling game for kids aged 8-15. The game will ask the user for their name, age, and favorite color. Based on this input, the game will generate a personalized greeting message and a fun fact about their favorite color. This exercise will help you practice creating variables of different data types (string, integer) and printing them in a meaningful way.

**Tasks:**
1. Create variables to store the user's name, age, and favorite color.
2. Print a personalized greeting message using these variables.
3. Print a fun fact about the user's favorite color.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Provide starter code with strategically placed blanks that the student must fill in to complete the functionality. The code should include comments and guidance relevant to Storytelling and be appropriate for someone with Intermediate experience.

```python
# Starter code for creating an interactive storytelling game

# Get user input for name, age, and favorite color
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
favorite_color = input("Enter your favorite color: ")

# Create variables to store the inputs
user_name = _______
user_age = _______
user_favorite_color = _______

# Print a personalized greeting message
print("Hello, " + _______ + "! At " + _______ + " years old, you have a great taste in colors!")

# Print a fun fact about the user's favorite color
if user_favorite_color.lower() == "blue":
    print("Did you know? Blue is often associated with depth and stability.")
elif user_favorite_color.lower() == "red":
    print("Did you know? Red is the color of energy, passion, and action.")
elif user_favorite_color.lower() == "green":
    print("Did you know? Green symbolizes growth, harmony, and freshness.")
else:
    print("Wow! " + _______ + " is a unique and wonderful color!")
```

#### 3. Hints
Provide hints that help the student solve the exercise without giving away the answer. These hints should reinforce the lecture concepts and guide the student through applying them in the exercise.

**Hints:**
1. Remember to use the `input()` function to capture user input and assign it to variables.
2. Use string concatenation (`+`) to combine strings when printing the personalized greeting message.
3. Ensure that the variable names you use match those in the print statements for consistency.
4. Use `.lower()` method to handle different cases of color input (e.g., "Blue", "blue", "BLUE").

#### 4. Expected Outcome
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how the concepts apply to real-world scenarios in EdTech. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

**Expected Solution:**
```python
# Starter code for creating an interactive storytelling game

# Get user input for name, age, and favorite color
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
favorite_color = input("Enter your favorite color: ")

# Create variables to store the inputs
user_name = name
user_age = age
user_favorite_color = favorite_color

# Print a personalized greeting message
print("Hello, " + user_name + "! At " + user_age + " years old, you have a great taste in colors!")

# Print a fun fact about the user's favorite color
if user_favorite_color.lower() == "blue":
    print("Did you know? Blue is often associated with depth and stability.")
elif user_favorite_color.lower() == "red":
    print("Did you know? Red is the color of energy, passion, and action.")
elif user_favorite_color.lower() == "green":
    print("Did you know? Green symbolizes growth, harmony, and freshness.")
else:
    print("Wow! " + user_favorite_color + " is a unique and wonderful color!")
```

### Integration
Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.

---

By completing this exercise, students will gain hands-on experience in creating variables of different data types and using them in an interactive storytelling context. This aligns with their career goals of teaching coding to kids by making learning fun and interactive.
