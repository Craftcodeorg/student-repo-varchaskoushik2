### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. **Problem Statement**

Create an exercise that requires the student to apply "Exercise 4: Implement a for loop to iterate over a list of numbers" to a scenario directly related to the content covered in the lecture on control structures.

**Scenario:**

You are developing an interactive storytelling game for kids. In this game, players collect magical items during their adventure. You need to implement a feature that calculates the total power level of the collected items. Each item has a specific power level, and you will use a `for` loop to iterate over a list of items to calculate the total power.

**Task:**

Write a Python function `calculate_total_power` that takes a list of integers representing the power levels of collected items and returns the total power level. Use a `for` loop to iterate over the list and sum the power levels.

---

#### 2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**

```python
# Function to calculate the total power level of collected items
def calculate_total_power(items):
    # Initialize total power to 0
    total_power = 0
    
    # Iterate over each item in the list
    for item in ______:
        # Add the item's power level to total_power
        total_power += _______
    
    # Return the total power level
    return total_power

# Example list of item power levels
item_powers = [5, 10, 3, 8, 7]

# Calculate and print the total power level
print(calculate_total_power(_______))
```

---

#### 3. **Hints**

1. **Hint 1:** Remember that you need to iterate over each element in the list. Use the `for` loop structure discussed in the lecture.
2. **Hint 2:** When iterating over the list, you can access each element directly within the loop.
3. **Hint 3:** The list `item_powers` contains the power levels of the items collected by the player. Pass this list as an argument when calling the `calculate_total_power` function.

---

#### 4. **Expected Outcome**

The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to use a `for` loop to iterate over a list and sum its elements. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

**Completed Code:**

```python
# Function to calculate the total power level of collected items
def calculate_total_power(items):
    # Initialize total power to 0
    total_power = 0
    
    # Iterate over each item in the list
    for item in items:
        # Add the item's power level to total_power
        total_power += item
    
    # Return the total power level
    return total_power

# Example list of item power levels
item_powers = [5, 10, 3, 8, 7]

# Calculate and print the total power level
print(calculate_total_power(item_powers))
```

**Expected Output:**

```
33
```

This output indicates that the student has successfully implemented a `for` loop to iterate over a list of numbers and calculate their sum, applying the concepts from the lecture.
