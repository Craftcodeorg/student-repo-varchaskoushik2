### Exercise Requirements ###

#### Exercise 1: Creating an Interactive Story Introduction ####

**Problem Statement:**

In this exercise, you will create a simple Python program that introduces a story to kids. Your task is to write a Python program that prints a welcoming message and sets the stage for an interactive story. This exercise will help you apply the concepts from the lecture, particularly focusing on Python's simplicity and readability, making it engaging for kids aged 8-15.

**Scenario:**

You are designing an interactive story for kids. The first step is to print a welcoming message that captures their attention and sets the scene for the adventure. Use the `print` function to display the message "Hello, Adventurer! Welcome to the magical world of Python!" on the screen.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code ####

```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts

# Function to print the welcoming message for the interactive story
def welcome_message():
    # Print a welcoming message to the screen
    print("Hello, Adventurer! Welcome to the magical world of Python!")

# Call the function to display the message
welcome_message()
```

#### Hints ####

1. **Understanding the `print` Function:**
   - Recall from the lecture that the `print` function is used to display text on the screen.
   - The syntax for the `print` function is `print("your text here")`.

2. **Function Definition and Calling:**
   - Define a function using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parentheses.
   - Call the function by using its name followed by parentheses.

3. **Creating Engaging Content:**
   - Think about what kind of messages would be engaging for kids. Use simple and exciting language.

#### Expected Outcome ####

The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to use the `print` function and define and call functions in Python. The final solution should print the message "Hello, Adventurer! Welcome to the magical world of Python!" when executed.

**Expected Output:**

```
Hello, Adventurer! Welcome to the magical world of Python!
```

This exercise reinforces the lecture concepts by having students apply basic Python syntax in a fun and educational context. It also aligns with their career goals of teaching coding to kids through engaging storytelling.
