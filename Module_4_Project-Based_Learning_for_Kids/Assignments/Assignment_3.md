### Assignment 3: Develop an Educational Game Using Scratch

#### Problem Statement:
Create an educational game using Scratch that teaches kids about loops and conditionals. The game should incorporate storytelling elements to make the learning experience engaging and memorable. You will develop a simple game where players help a character complete a series of tasks by using loops and conditionals.

#### Learning Objectives:
By the end of this assignment, you will be able to:
- Apply storytelling techniques to create an engaging educational game.
- Use loops and conditionals in Scratch to solve problems.
- Design a game that is both educational and fun for kids aged 8-15.

### Assignment Components:

#### 1. Problem Statement:
Design a game where the player helps a character (e.g., a robot or an explorer) navigate through different levels by solving puzzles that require the use of loops and conditionals. Each level should represent a chapter in the story, and the player must complete coding tasks to progress.

Example:
"Create a game where players help a robot collect items in a maze. The robot must use loops to move through the maze efficiently and conditionals to avoid obstacles."

#### 2. Starter Code:
Provide a basic framework in Scratch that students will build upon. This includes setting up the environment, characters, and initial storyline. Include comments to guide students on where to implement their solutions.

Example:
```scratch
// Starter code for Scratch educational game
// Setting up the environment and characters

// Character: Robot
when green flag clicked
go to x: -150 y: 0
say "Help me collect all the items!" for 2 seconds

// Initial setup for the maze
when green flag clicked
set up maze with items and obstacles

// Player controls
when [up arrow v] key pressed
move 10 steps
if on edge, bounce

when [down arrow v] key pressed
move -10 steps
if on edge, bounce

when [left arrow v] key pressed
turn left 15 degrees

when [right arrow v] key pressed
turn right 15 degrees

// Task: Use loops to move through the maze
// Task: Use conditionals to avoid obstacles
```

#### 3. Detailed Instructions:
Break down the task into clear, manageable steps. Each step should guide the student on what they need to add or modify in the starter code, ensuring they understand the purpose of each part.

Example:
**Step 1: Set Up the Maze**
- Add items (e.g., stars) and obstacles (e.g., rocks) in the maze.
- Ensure the robot starts at the beginning of the maze.

**Step 2: Implement Loops**
- Use loops to move the robot through the maze.
- Example: "Repeat until the robot reaches the end of the maze."

**Step 3: Implement Conditionals**
- Use conditionals to check for obstacles.
- Example: "If the robot encounters a rock, turn left."

**Step 4: Create Story Elements**
- Add dialogues and story elements that guide the player through each level.
- Example: "After collecting all items, the robot says 'Great job! Let's move to the next level!'"

**Step 5: Test and Refine**
- Test the game to ensure it works as intended.
- Refine the game based on feedback and observations.

#### 4. Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
Define the success criteria clearly so students understand how their work will be assessed. Include a rubric that highlights the importance of accuracy, code quality, and adherence to instructions.

Example:
**Success Criteria:**
- The game correctly uses loops and conditionals to navigate through the maze.
- The story elements are engaging and guide the player through each level.
- The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
- The game is fun and educational for kids aged 8-15.

**Rubric:**
| Criteria                | Excellent (5)       | Good (4)           | Satisfactory (3)    | Needs Improvement (2) | Unsatisfactory (1)   |
|-------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Use of Loops            | Correctly uses loops in all tasks | Mostly correct use of loops | Some correct use of loops | Limited use of loops | Incorrect use of loops |
| Use of Conditionals     | Correctly uses conditionals in all tasks | Mostly correct use of conditionals | Some correct use of conditionals | Limited use of conditionals | Incorrect use of conditionals |
| Story Elements          | Highly engaging story elements | Engaging story elements | Somewhat engaging story elements | Limited story elements | No story elements |
| Code Quality            | Clean, well-documented code | Mostly clean code with some documentation | Somewhat clean code with limited documentation | Poorly organized code with little documentation | Disorganized code with no documentation |
| Fun and Educational     | Highly engaging and educational game | Engaging and educational game | Somewhat engaging and educational game | Limited engagement or educational value | No engagement or educational value |

By completing this assignment, you will have created an engaging educational game that teaches kids about loops and conditionals while incorporating storytelling elements to make learning fun and interactive.
