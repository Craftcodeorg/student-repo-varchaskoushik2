### Module Title: Project-Based Learning for Kids

### Exercise 3: Add Multimedia Elements (Images, Sounds) to Your Project

#### Problem Statement
In this exercise, you will enhance your coding project by adding multimedia elements such as images and sounds. This will make the project more engaging and interactive for young learners. You will apply the storytelling techniques discussed in the lecture to create a more immersive experience.

**Scenario**: You are creating a "Space Adventure Coding Project" for kids. The students are astronauts on a mission to save a distant planet. You need to add multimedia elements to make the story come alive. Specifically, you will:
1. Add an image of a spaceship at the beginning of the mission.
2. Play a sound when the spaceship launches.
3. Display an image of the planet when the mission is completed.

#### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
# Import necessary libraries
import pygame
from PIL import Image

# Initialize pygame for sound playback
pygame.init()

# Function to display an image
def display_image(image_path):
    img = Image.open(image_path)
    img.show()

# Function to play a sound
def play_sound(sound_path):
    pygame.mixer.music.load(sound_path)
    pygame.mixer.music.play()

# Function to simulate the spaceship launch sequence with multimedia elements
def launch_sequence():
    # Display spaceship image
    display_image("spaceship.jpg")
    
    # Print launch message
    print("3... 2... 1... Lift off!")
    
    # Play launch sound
    play_sound("launch_sound.mp3")

# Function to simulate mission completion with multimedia elements
def mission_complete():
    # Display planet image
    display_image("planet.jpg")
    
    # Print completion message
    print("Mission Complete! You've saved the planet!")

# Main function to run the project
def main():
    launch_sequence()
    # Simulate some mission tasks here (omitted for brevity)
    mission_complete()

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Hints
1. **Displaying Images**: Ensure that the image files ("spaceship.jpg" and "planet.jpg") are in the same directory as your script or provide the correct path.
2. **Playing Sounds**: Make sure you have the sound file ("launch_sound.mp3") in the correct format and path.
3. **Pygame Initialization**: Remember to call `pygame.init()` before using any pygame functions.
4. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling to check if the files exist before attempting to display or play them.

#### Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate an understanding of how to integrate multimedia elements into coding projects to enhance storytelling and engagement for young learners. The final solution should:
- Display an image of a spaceship at the beginning of the mission.
- Play a sound when the spaceship launches.
- Display an image of the planet when the mission is completed.

The code should be well-commented, explaining each step and ensuring that it adheres to best practices.

### Integration
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.

This exercise aligns with your interests in storytelling, learning experience design, and game-based learning, providing a practical application that resonates with your career goals in EdTech.
