### Module Title: Project-Based Learning for Kids ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

1. **Problem Statement**:
   Create a problem that requires the student to apply "Exercise 1: Outline a project that teaches basic coding concepts through storytelling" to a scenario directly related to the content covered in the lecture "Introduction to Project-Based Learning (PBL): Benefits and challenges."

   #### Problem Statement:
   You are tasked with designing a project for kids aged 8-15 that combines storytelling with basic coding concepts using Scratch. The goal is to create an interactive story where characters can move, speak, and interact based on user inputs. This project should leverage the principles of Project-Based Learning (PBL) to enhance engagement, develop practical skills, and provide a deeper understanding of coding.

   **Requirements:**
   - Design a simple interactive story with at least two characters.
   - Each character should have at least three different actions (e.g., move, speak, change costume).
   - Use basic coding constructs such as loops, conditionals, and events.
   - Incorporate user input to influence the story's progression.
   - Ensure the project is engaging and educational, keeping in mind the age group.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
   Provide starter code with strategically placed blanks that the student must fill in to complete the functionality. The code should include comments and guidance relevant to storytelling and be appropriate for someone with Intermediate experience.

   ```scratch
   # Scratch Starter Code for Storytelling Project

   when green flag clicked
   say "Welcome to our interactive story!" for 2 seconds

   # Define the first character's actions
   when this sprite clicked
   say "Hi! I'm Character 1." for 2 seconds
   move 10 steps
   wait 1 second
   say "What should I do next?" for 2 seconds
   # Implement user input to decide the next action
   if <answer = "jump"> then
       _______ 10 steps
       say "I jumped!" for 2 seconds
   else
       _______ -10 steps
       say "I moved back!" for 2 seconds
   end

   # Define the second character's actions
   when this sprite clicked
   say "Hello! I'm Character 2." for 2 seconds
   change costume to "costume2"
   wait 1 second
   say "Watch me change!" for 2 seconds
   ```

3. **Hints**:
   - Think about how you want each character to interact with the user. What kind of responses or actions would make the story engaging?
   - Remember to use loops for repetitive actions and conditionals to handle different user inputs.
   - Use events to trigger actions when the user interacts with characters (e.g., clicking on a sprite).
   - Refer back to the lecture notes on PBL benefits and challenges to ensure your project is both engaging and educational.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how the concepts apply to real-world scenarios in EdTech. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

### Integration ###

Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
